Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br></em><br><u>Note on the responsible body</u><br><em>The responsible body for data processing on this website is:&nbsp;</em>r2 Invest GmbH<br><br><em>E-Mail: info@r2advisors.com</em><br><br><em>The responsible body is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</em><br><br><u>Storage period</u><br><em>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this data protection declaration, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will take place once these reasons no longer apply.</em><br><br><u>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</u><br><em>If you have consented to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Section 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is required to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration.<br></em><u><br>Recipients of personal data</u><br><em>As part of our business activities, we work with various external bodies. In some cases, this also requires the transmission of personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies if this is necessary to fulfill a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR or if another legal basis allows the data to be passed on. When using contract processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.<br></em><br><u>Revocation of your consent to data processing</u><br><em>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the time of revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</em><br><br><u>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</u><br><em>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARAGRAPH 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).<br><br>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING IN SO FAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).<br></em><br><u>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</u><br><em>In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</em><br><br><u>Right to data portability</u><br><em>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request that the data be transferred directly to another responsible party, this will only be done if it is technically feasible.<br></em><br><u>Information, correction and deletion</u><br><em>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time with regard to this and other questions on the subject of personal data.<br></em><br><u>Right to restriction of processing</u><br><em>You have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted. You can contact us at any time to do so. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:<br><br>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the check, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.<br>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request that the data processing be restricted instead of deleted.<br><br>If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to</em><br><br><u>Deletion and restriction of the processing of your personal data.</u><br><em>If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br><br>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may - with the exception of storage - only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.<br></em><strong><br></strong><br><strong><br>4.
